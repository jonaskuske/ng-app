## Instructions

### Installation

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
On WSL, you also need to [install and configure an X-server in order for Cypress to work](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.com/blog/gui-on-wsl2-cypress).

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. The app will be served on `http://localhost:4200/ng-app/`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Testing

Run `npm test` to run all unit tests with Jest.

> ðŸ’¡ Additionally, `npm run test:watch` starts Jest in watch mode, and `npm run test:coverage` reports code coverage.

Run `npm run e2e` to start the dev server, then run all E2E tests with Cypress.

> ðŸ’¡ During development you can run `npm run e2e:open` to open Cypress in another window. It connects to the already running dev server and shows you test results as you edit the code.
